Python Control Flow :
Title: Continue (Skip Multiples of 5)

Concept:
The continue statement is used inside loops to skip the current iteration when a condition is True and move to the next iteration.
In this program, all numbers that are multiples of 5 are skipped from being printed.

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
The loop runs from 1 to 49.
When a number divisible by 5 is found (i % 5 == 0), the continue statement is triggered.
The current iteration is skipped, and control moves to the next value of i.
