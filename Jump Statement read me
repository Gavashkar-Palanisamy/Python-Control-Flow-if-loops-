Python Control Flow :
Title: Jump Statement

Concept:
These are special statements used to control the flow of loops in Python.

break	: Exits the loop immediately when a condition is met	Stop loop when i == 3
continue : Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one	Skip printing when i == 4
pass	: Does nothing; used as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
break → Terminates the loop.
continue → Skips to the next iteration.
pass → Keeps code syntactically valid without any operation.
