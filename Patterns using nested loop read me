Title: Patterns using nested loop

Concept:
A nested loop means one loop inside another.
It’s used when you need to perform repeated actions within another repeated action — such as generating rows and columns for grids, tables, or patterns.

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
Outer loop (i) controls the number of rows.
Inner loop (j) controls the number of columns (how many * are printed per row).
After completing each row, the print('') moves the cursor to the next line.
