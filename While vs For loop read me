Pyhton Control Flow :
Title: For Loop and While Loop in Python

Concept:
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.
For Loop: Used when the number of iterations is known or fixed (e.g., repeating 6 times).
While Loop: Used when the number of iterations is unknown, and it depends on a condition being True.

Logic Flow:
for iterates over a range or sequence.
while runs as long as the condition remains True.
To prevent infinite loops, update the variable inside the loop.
