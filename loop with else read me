Python Control Flow :
Title: Loop with else

Concept:
The for loop goes through all elements.
If the number is found, the break stops the loop → else is skipped.
If the loop completes fully without break, the else executes — signaling that the item wasn’t found

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
search the number which is given as input
if found, else with be skipped, otherwise else will execute
